# Railway Healthcheck Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue

The `/ready` healthcheck was failing on Railway deployment.

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` had `apscheduler` but the code was using `schedule` library
2. **Storage Path Issues**: The storage was trying to create `/data` directory even in local development
3. **Import Errors**: Missing `requests` and `schedule` dependencies caused import failures

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Dependencies

- **Before**: `apscheduler>=3.10.0` in requirements.txt
- **After**: `schedule>=1.2.0` (matching the actual code usage)

### 2. Fixed Storage Paths

- **Before**: Always tried to create `/data` directory
- **After**: Smart path detection:
  - Production/Railway: Uses `/data` with environment variables
  - Local development: Uses current directory
  - Graceful fallback if directory creation fails

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added proper exception handling for directory creation
- Better environment detection (Railway vs local)
- Graceful degradation for storage issues

## 🧪 Verification

All endpoints now working:

- ✅ `/ready` - Railway healthcheck endpoint
- ✅ `/health` - Detailed health status
- ✅ `/` - API root with metadata
- ✅ `/stacks` - Main functionality

## 🚀 Railway Configuration

The Railway configuration is correct:

- **Start Command**: `python run_server.py` (robust import handling)
- **Healthcheck Path**: `/ready` (simple, fast endpoint)
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds (sufficient for cold starts)

## 📋 Environment Variables for Railway

### Required for Production:

```bash
# API Service
DATA_PATH=/data/stacks.json
HISTORY_PATH=/data/history.json
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-web-domain.com

# Web Service
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-service.up.railway.app
```

### Optional:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here  # For higher API rate limits
```

## 🔧 Local Development

The API now works seamlessly in both environments:

```bash
# Local development
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_server.py

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/ready
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway**: The healthcheck should now pass
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure the paths and CORS origins
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway logs for successful startup
4. **Test Integration**: Verify web frontend can connect to API

The `/ready` healthcheck failure should now be resolved! 🎉
